</br>

<p class="intro"> Hello, everyone! My name is Lauren Vogel. I am <b> twenty-seven, </b> about to turn <b> twenty-eight </b> <i> in July, </i> and am a student at <a href = "https://www.gmu.edu/"> George Mason University. </a>
I am currently working towards my <b> English degree </b> and hope one day to become a published author. <br> 
</br>

My current passions include fanfiction, specifically <i> Star Wars </i> although I occasionally branch out into other fandoms. I have been practicing fanfiction since I was eleven years old when my eye doctor
recommended it to me thanks to his daughter being into fanfiction. (Thank you, Doctor!) I believe that fanfiction <i> is </i> a valid form of storytelling, and can even dodge around issues that original fiction unfortunately can get hobbled by, such as
the executives meddling in things. 

My degree I'm aspiring to is a <b> Bachelor's Degree. </b> <i> Avenue Q </i> might have <i> asked </i> once what you do with a B.A. in English, but I'll find a way. </p>

<h3> The Website Itself </h3> <br>
</br>

<pclass="website"> I should say that the "About Me" and "Portfolio" sections are definitely just me showing off what I have. Most of the portfolio page is links to my original works written on Archiveofourown (or AO3) which allows original work as well as the expected fanfiction.
It has been most useful for when I've felt the need to dabble in original fiction. <br>
</br>

In addition, I actually have posted the first original fiction novel I've completed for NaNoWriMo, Raised by Wolves. The short version is a girl who is raised by werewolves and has to deal with a werewolf hunter with a vendetta. It was definitely quite a milestone for me, I think. </p>
