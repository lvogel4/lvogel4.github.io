<h1> Lauren Vogel </h1> <br>


Hello, everyone! My name is Lauren Vogel. I am <b> twenty-seven, </b> about to turn <b> twenty-eight </b> <i> in July, </i> and am a student at <a href = "https://www.gmu.edu/"> George Mason University. </a>
I am currently working towards my <b> English degree </b> and hope one day to become a published author. <br> 
</br>

My current passions include fanfiction, specifically <i> Star Wars </i> although I occasionally branch out into other fandoms. I have been practicing fanfiction since I was eleven years old when my eye doctor
recommended it to me thanks to his daughter being into fanfiction. (Thank you, Doctor!) I believe that fanfiction <i> is </i> a valid form of storytelling, and can even dodge around issues that original fiction unfortunately can get hobbled by, such as
the executives meddling in things. 

My degree I'm aspiring to is a <b> Bachelor's Degree. </b> <i> Avenue Q </i> might have <i> asked </i> once what you do with a B.A. in English, but I'll find a way. </p>
