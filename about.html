<h1> About Me </h1> <br>
</br>

In terms of information about me, I would say that I'm currently a college student at GMU. I'm a transfer student previously from NOVA; it's safe to say that my transfer was a bit complicated.
Basically, I started off at the NOVA in Manassas (partially at the advice of my LiveJournal friends, and I think they definitely helped me make the right decision. Even though Manassas NOVA didn't work
out as well as I thought, I did learn that NOVA in general was a good way to get a head start. <br>
</br>
 
I ended up completing my General Studies degree at Loudoun NOVA, where I participated at College Steps. I can safely say College Steps was one of my most productive experiences, especially given that I am
neurodivergent (autism spectrum, anxiety, and OCD) and the peer mentors and teachers alike did a good job in terms of making me feel welcome. <br>
</br>

I am at George Mason University, currently. I am a year away from graduating and getting my Bachelor's Degree, which I am proud of. <br>
</br>


<h2> Skills and Experiences </h2> <br>
</br>

If one was to ask what one of my greatest strengths is, I would say it is my writing ability and my verbal ability. From the age of four, I was writing -- rather childish stories, what you'd expect from a four year old, but
it's still prominent. In addition, I have become skilled at video editing, art, photography, and critical analysis (albeit critical analysis I've done in my free time). Math has never been one of my strong suits, but I think thanks
to a particularly good teacher at College Steps, I became good at it. I am also good at picking up on new skills quickly. <br>
</br>

In terms of my experiences, I unfortunately have not had many writing-related internships or volunteer jobs. I have, however, had volunteer experience before, namely volunteering at the organization Earth Sangha in order to help out with plants and taking care of them.
In addition, I currently volunteer at a library where my job typically involves finding missing books as well as doing the occasional mark-outs (in other words, marking which books can't be used by the library anymore), folding papers, and more. I would say that it is a quite
rewarding experience, especially given my supportive boss and co-workers, as well as having the opportunity to be around books. (Always a plus!) <br>
</br>

<h2> More About Me </h2> <br>
</br>

In terms of the career I've been looking for, it mostly involves one day becoming a writer. A published author, more specifically. From the beginning, I have always been fascinated with works of fiction that I've loved and have a desire to create my own. I have currently been into fanfiction since I was eleven years old (at the suggestion
of my eye doctor, apparently, who had a daughter around my age into the very medium), but I have a desire to branch out into original fiction for myself. My influences have been media such as Star Wars; I hope one day to create a space opera that people will appreciate. <br>
